# Resources

A resource is an atomic unit of data. For instance, if your application manages books,
then each individual book object would be a resource.

In Standard Resource, each resource has a similar structure. The following guides
cover the different aspects of a resource.

* [Resource Data](resource-data.md)
* [Creating Resources](creating-resources.md)
* [Retrieving Resources](retrieving-resources.md)
* [Updating Resources](updating-resources.md)
* [Deleting Resources](deleting-resources.md)
* [Using Computed Attributes](using-computed-attributes.md)
* [Schemas](schemas.md)
