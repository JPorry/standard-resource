# Resources

A resource is an atomic unit of data. For instance, if your application manages books,
then each individual book object would be a resource.

In Standard Resource, each resource has a similar structure. The following guides
cover the different aspects of a resource.

* [Type](type.md)
* [IDs](ids.md)
* [Attributes](attributes.md)
* [Computed Attributes](computed-attributes.md)
* [Meta](meta.md)
* [Schemas](schemas.md)
