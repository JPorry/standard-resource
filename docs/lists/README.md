# Lists

Applications frequently need to group resources together. Sometimes, you need an ordered
group, such as a sorted list of resources. Other times, you may need an unordered
group, such as the list of resources that a user has selected on an interface.

Lists are designed for these use cases. Anytime that you need a grouping of resources,
you should use lists.
