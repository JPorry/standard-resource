# Removing

The store provides a single method to remove data from the state tree: `remove()`. Using
this method, you can:

* delete an entire resource
* remove data from a resource, such as specific attributes or meta
* delete an entire list
* remove resources from a list

You can even do multiple of these things at the same time with a single call to `remove()`.
